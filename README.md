# WhoHasWhat-CapstoneApi

## Purpose
  This application is meant as an assistant in communities where borrowing supplies and other such items is common. Owners will be able to post what is available for rent, while renters will be able to request those items to use themselves. 
  
## Deployment
  Deployed through Heroku to https://whohaswhat.herokuapp.com/
  
## Purpose
  The idea for this design occured to me when I saw something I had borrowed as a child and never returned. I thought to myself, "I wish I would have kept track of things like that better than I did". I quickly realized I could run with that idea and make something bigger with it! The deployed version now is basic, but the idea is a community can have people register to either loan items out, or rent items for their own use. The long-term goals would allow users to charge and pay money for higher-level rentals.
