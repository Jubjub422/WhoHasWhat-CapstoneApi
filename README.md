# WhoHasWhat-CapstoneApi
  
## Deployment
  Deployed through Heroku to https://whohaswhat.herokuapp.com/
  
## Purpose
  The idea for this design occured to me when I saw something I had borrowed as a child and never returned. I thought to myself, "I wish I would have kept track of things like that better than I did". I quickly realized I could run with that idea and make something bigger with it! The deployed version now is basic, but the idea is a community can have people register to either loan items out, or rent items for their own use. The long-term goals would allow users to charge and pay money for higher-level rentals.

## Challenges
  This was the first solo project I had where I had to create almost every bit of it from scratch. I realized quickly as I was planning that this could get very out of hand very quickly so the first big challenge was planning appropriately. When I started coding, I had to constantly look back at my plan and make sure I was on the right track so I didn't waste any time doing something that would have to be undone later. As far as challenges in coding, the biggest challenge was working with rental requests. I had not done something quite like it before and it took me a few days to wrap my head around what it should look like and what exactly should be happening behind the scenes in the API. Resolving that issue was a big win for me!
